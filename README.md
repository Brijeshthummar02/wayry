## 💻 Development

1. First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
> I use `npm` for this projet, but feel free to also try using `yarn`, `pnpm`, or `bun`. Do tell me if anything breaks :)

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project **USED** to use [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font... before for some reason it got buggy so I had to remove it :(
